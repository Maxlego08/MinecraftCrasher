### Minecraft Crasher is a handshake crasher that i will create FOR FREE because fixmem that doesn't have any knowledge about crashing started making his own crasher. So you can't fucking skid this even if you are german (or fixmem, yes he isn't human, this is new human under race).

### Features
- LazyLoading for crashers
